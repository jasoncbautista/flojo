# Flojo

## What?

A no-backend backend framework.  


## Goal

To remove friction in prototyping web apps.



## Premise

  A lot of code in a webapp doesn't really eer need to be written, it's all boilerplate, wasting precious cycles. Let's get computers to do our work for us.

## How does it work?


### Problem

 Writing backend code for models, setting up correspodning databases and then writtigin corresponding front-end code is tedious.
 
 
### Solution

Leverage a framework, Flojo, that allows users to create apps quickly using forms and hooks. 


Most of the code will be generated by the framework and the user can concentrate on writting some frontend javascript and necessary services to support the core of their app. 


REST based APIs are automatically generated, but furthermore, corresponding Model code is written and generated, making it easy for users to quickly write complex prototypes with real backends. 

### Sample Interface

#### Creating an Entity
